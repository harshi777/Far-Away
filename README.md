## 🚀 My Learning Journey

Building **Far Away** has been an exciting adventure in learning React! Along the way, I’ve dived into:

- **State Management** 🛠️: Mastering the ins and outs of component states.
- **Lifting State Up** ⬆️: Sharing state seamlessly between components.
- **Derived State** 🔍: Crafting new states based on existing ones.
- **Controlled Components** 🎛️: Managing forms with finesse.

This project has not only honed my skills but also fueled my passion for coding. I can’t wait to continue my journey! 💻✨
